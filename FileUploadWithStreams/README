This sample demonstrates how to stream a file to a remote server,
compressing and decompressing the data on the fly.

Some more notes on streams:
  Streams are composed using pipe method
  The pipe method allows to connect different processing units (e.g read file, write file, compress file etc)
  Each processing unit does only one thing (single responsibility principle)
  The processing units must also be streams
  Since streams have uniform interface, the processing units can understand eachother in terms of API
  Note: the next stream in the pipeline must support the data type produced by the previous stream

Add add an encryption layer

To run the program first start the server:
  node server

Then run the client selecting the file to send:
  node client <path to file> localhost
