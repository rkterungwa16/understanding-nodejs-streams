How to compress a file by gzip using node buffered API
  Buffer data and process it all at once
  Return a buffer when the operation is complete(Read, write etc)

Brief description of buffer mode:
  Buffer mode causes all the data coming from a resource to be collected into a buffer
  It is then passed to a callback as soon as the entire resource is read

With Buffer mode there is limit to the size of file that can be read
  Buffers in V8 cannot be greater than `0X3FFFFFFF bytes`
  A file greater than this amount will throw `RangeError: Array buffer allocation failed`

Operations on buffers are sequential: One operation must complete before the next starts

To run the program issue the command:
  node bufferGzip <path to file>

The gzipped file will be created in the same directory of the original file.
