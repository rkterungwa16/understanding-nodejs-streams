How to compress a file by gzip using node streaming API
  Node stream module's primary composition operator is called .pipe()
  Plug the output of one stream to the input of another stream
  Example of streams in Node:
   fs.createReadStream
   fs.createWriteStream
   response and request object
   zlib.createGzip

Brief description of stream mode:
  With Stream mode, you start using the data the moment a stream is created.

With streams you can run operations on files of any size

Operations on streams are concurrent: Two or more operations can performed on same data at the same time

To run the program issue the command:
  node streamGzip <path to file>

The gzipped file will be created in the same directory of the original file.
