What is a duplex stream?
  It is a stream that is both Readable and Writable.

  It is useful when we want to describe an entity that is both
  a data source and a data destination, such as network
  sockets

Creating a custom duplex
  Provide an implementation for both _read() and _write()

  The 'options' object passed to the Duplex() constructor is
  internally forwaded to both the Readable and Writable
  constructors.

  options.objectMode
  options.highWaterMark
  options.decodeStrings
  options.allowHalfOpen: defaults to true
    if false will cause Readable and Writable parts of the
    stream to end if only one of them does

Transform streams

  These are a special kind of Duplex stream that are
  specifically designed to handle data transformations

  No immediate relationship between the data read from
  the stream and the data written into the stream.

    Example: TCP socket, sends and recieves data to and
    from the remote peer; the socket is not aware of any
    relationship between the input and output

  Transforms streams apply some kind of transformation to
  each chunk of data that they recieve from their Writable
  side and then make the transformed data available on their
  Readable side.
