what is a Buffer?
  Buffers are Node.js built-in type for storing arbitary binary data.

  A buffer is an area of memory.

  It represents a fixed-size chunk of memory (can’t be resized) allocated outside of the V8 JavaScript engine.

  Array of integers, which each represent a byte of data.

Why do we need a Buffer?

  Buffers were introduced to help developers deal with binary data,
  in an ecosystem that traditionally only dealt with strings rather than binaries.

  Buffers are deeply linked with streams.
  When a stream processor receives data faster than it can digest, it puts the data in a buffer.

  A simple visualization of a buffer is when you are watching a YouTube video and the red line goes beyond your visualization point:
  you are downloading data faster than you’re viewing it, and your browser buffers it.
